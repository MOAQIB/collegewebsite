Why it is important to identify the object in web
development strategies ? Also explain, with the help of block diagram,
web development process.

It is essential to identify objects in web development strategies because it will
help the developer to understand the elements that play a vital role in business
applications.
Web development process :
The process of website development can be divided into following different
life cycle steps :

1. Analysis
2. Specification Building
3. Design and Development
4. Content Writing
5. Coding
6. Testing
7. Maintenance and Updation

1. Analysis :
a. In this phase, all the information required for the web project is
gathered.
b. Analysis of the requirement given by the customer is done by the
group of programmers and designers.

2. Specification building :
a. In this phase, Software Requirement Specifications (SRS) document
is prepared.
b. In this document each and every element of the requirement is
presented in detailed form.

3. Design and development :
a. In design phase, the layouts and navigation will be designed as a
prototype.
b. Test plans and procedures are developed for quality assurance.
c. In development phase, team will develop the database with all the
data structures and sample data according to the requirements.

4. Content writing : There are professional content developers who
write industry specific and relevant content for the site. The grammatical
and spelling check should be done in this phase.

5. Coding :
a. In coding stage programmers add the code without disturbing the
design.
b. Coding team generate necessary testing plans as well as technical
documentation.

6. Testing :
a. Both automated testing and manual testing should be done without
fail.
b. After doing all the testing, a live testing is necessary for websites
and web based applications. After uploading the site there should
be a complete testing.

7. Maintenance and updation : Once the website is operational, ongoing
promotion, technical maintenance, content management and staff
training is needed on a regular basis.

Q:-02  what is the life Cycle of a Servlet?
ans:-The entire life cycle of a Servlet is managed by the Servlet container
 which uses the javax.servlet.Servlet interface to understand the Servlet object 
and manage it. So, before creating a Servlet object, letâ€™s first understand the 
life cycle of the Servlet object which is actually understanding how the Servlet 
container manages the Servlet object.

Stages of the Servlet Life Cycle: 

1. Loading a Servlet.
2. Initializing the Servlet.
3. Request handling.
4. Destroying the Servlet.

1. Loading a Servlet:-
